## For windows users:
if you need vue devtools extension, when uncomment strings 14 - 21 in `src/main/index.dev.js`, but when you have to delete `DevTools Extensions` file in `C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Roaming\Electron` before every dev launch

Vue devtools on Mac and Linux not testet, but seems, that it is only windows related problem

# Chipboard
Design asset manager

This is a little pet project that grew from common frustrations as a designer and developer. I wanted a fast, simple, highly customizable tool for storing design assets. Starting with colors and eventually including support for fonts, vector and raster images, and text snippets.

I'm very new to Vue and Electron, but am a passionate developer and love to learn. I thought this would be a great opportunity to make something productive and learn really cool stuff.
